# Operation Instructions

## Steps

1. When entering for the first time, there will be no data displayed. You can choose to use default data to see the overall display effect. It is recommended to import your own data for operation. The steps are as follows:

    a. Personnel Configuration - Personnel List - Download Template, download the data template and modify it by filling in the data (please note that the header cannot be modified).

    b. After modification, click 'Upload File' on the same page to upload the modified Excel spreadsheet.

    Tip: If you need to display picture avatars, you can fill in URL links (https://) in the Excel table. If using URL links is inconvenient, you can fill in the avatar image name in the Excel sheet, then compress all images into a zip file and upload it. Upload the avatar zip package in Image Management, after which you'll be able to see avatars displayed normally in the personnel list. If you turn on "Show Avatar" in Interface Settings, avatars will also be displayed on the home page.

2. Go to Prize Configuration to modify your prize information. Keep the names short for better display; "Participate All" means whether this prize will be drawn from all participants (previously winners can still participate); Number of Winners refers to how many people will be drawn for this prize; Number of Awarded People cannot be edited; when "Drawn" is selected, it indicates the prize has been used, unchecking will reset the prize but won't reset already awarded people; the image is shown on the homepage as the prize picture (can be uploaded in the image list); the left icon adjusts the prize order.

After completing the above two items, normal usage is possible.

## Feature Description

1. Add Temporary Draw: There's a '+' button in the prize list on the draw page. Clicking it allows adding a temporary draw. Note: Only one temporary draw can be added at a time, and once successfully added, the current prize will be set to this temporary prize. After successful drawing, it returns to the normal prize list.
2. Music and Image Lists: You can upload files yourself for use. After images are successfully uploaded, they can be selected for display in prize configuration. After music is successfully uploaded, it is added to the playlist.
3. Music Playback: Left mouse click plays/pauses, right mouse click plays next track.
4. In Interface Configuration - Pattern Settings, you can customize highlight patterns on the home page with mouse clicks.
5. If you don't want to show the prize list on the home page, select 'Always Show Prize List' in Interface Configuration.
6. When clicking buttons on the home page, button values don't update immediately. They wait until the animation ends before updating to target value, which is normal behavior.
